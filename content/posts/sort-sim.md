In my journey to finally understand Data Structures & Algorithms (for real this time) I decided to document while I create my own implimentation of a sorting algorithm simulator.

#### **_Sorting algorithm [ASMR](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=sorting+algorithm+asmr) has entered the chat_**.

Thanks and credit to [sort.bullinger.dev](sort.bullinger.dev) for much of the inspiration behind this project.

## The Plan üëª

Light, readable, vanilla JS/HTMl/CSS ü§§

- Accepts some user input on

  - the size of the array to sort,
  - the type of sort,
  - the number of operations per second.

- A pretty and minimal UI that visualizes the sort with audio feedback.

## Day One

1. **Make this blog and research üî¨**

I started by setting up this domain with GitHub Pages, updated the CNAME and A records with Google, enabled HTTPS, and started to explore some of the challenges I anticiapted for the task ahead.

This site is made with Hugo, the theme is PapaerMod, and the repo has a custom GitHub action to build and deploy on push to master. Neat!

Now onto the project.

I was most unsure about music playback, specifically browser generated tones.

‚úÖ console.beep()

‚ùå /public/beep47.wav

I was curious about timing the audio and visuals together. Something something lifecycle.

I wanted to avoid relying on 100 different frequency .wav files and react bloat...

_Enter: new-to-me vanilla MDN Web APIs, [Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) üé® and [Web Audio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) üîä._

2. **don't-create-react-app**

Next, I resist my zombie urge to make everything a react app üßü‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

There has got to be a leaner, meaner, and more fighting way forward.

After trying to take a whack at it on my own, I realized that this wasn't going to be the walk in the park I thought it was.
_Enter: ‚ú®`<canvas></canvas>`‚ú®_

I leanred that the four ways to draw things on the web are: Canvas, SVG, CSS, and direct DOM animation.

Recognizing that Canvas would use less memory and provide more control than the alternatives, it makes sense here.

I continued on with anything I could do that didn't involve actually learning more about sorting algorithms. Whats the hex-code for lightblue, I wonder.

3. **Learn about Canvas**

ü•á [Canvas Deep Dive](https://bucephalus.org/text/CanvasHandbook/CanvasHandbook.html)

ü•à [The HTML5 Canvas Handbook](https://bucephalus.org/text/CanvasHandbook/CanvasHandbook.html)

Two interesting and thorough resources for learning more about this whole canvas thing!

These Web APIs could honeslty be a post of their own [ future idea? ].

I ended today with some preliminary learning / trial and error about different ways to make a website beep, but that is a topic for tomorrow.

## Day Two

1. **So whats up, Canvas? üë®‚Äçüé®**

_Enter: `CanvasRenderingContext2D.fillRect()`_ üíÖüëÅüëÑüëÅüíÖ

From MDN [herself](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/fillRect):

> The CanvasRenderingContext2D.fillRect() method of the Canvas 2D API draws a rectangle that is filled according to the current fillStyle.

`void ctx.fillRect(x, y, width, height);`

We can draw something, but how can we style it?

`ctx.fillStyle = color / gradient / pattern;`
Okay! We can work with this. We wanto to fill our 2d canvas, right?

Now we are getting somewhere.

I can toggle the state of a 'bar' and change its color individually. That should be a good place to start.
