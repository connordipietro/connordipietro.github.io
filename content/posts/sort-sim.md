In my journey to finally understand DS&A (for real this time) I decided to create my own version of a sorting algorithm simulator ðŸ‘€ ðŸŽ§

Also they are [cool](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=sorting+algorithm+asmr) ðŸ“º

## The Plan ðŸ‘»

Document the journey through this post.

Build a react app with

- some user input on

  - the size of the input array,
  - the type of sort performed,
  - and the number of operations per second.

- a pretty UI to visualize the sorts

  - and maybe some info as they are happening on the total # of acceses

- hosted as a github project page, linked to on this post.

## Day One

1. Set up this site with github pages, update the CNAME and A records with google domains, enable https, fix one small thing that was breaking everything, and consider flirting with starting the react app.

2. Figure out how to create a React app again. Kidding...

   `create-react-app`

   That was easy!

I started with anything I could do that didn't involve actually learning more about sorting algorithms.
